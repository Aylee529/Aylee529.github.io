					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something that I learned from this article is that the optimal speed for animations should be between 200 to 500
								ms. This is based on how fast humans process information as well as certain qualities of the human brain. It 
								was interesting how even 1 second is too slow and may cause the user to become bored.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was watching all of the different animations. It helpful in identifying 
								how the animations should function. It also made me think back to past digital deisgns where similar animation 
								was implemented.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> So, the duration of web transitions should last about 2 times shorter than on mobile devices — between 150–200 
								ms. In other cases, the user will inevitably think that the computer freezes or has troubles with the internet connection </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
