					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about the concept of being color accessible and including those who may suffer from visual impairment. 
								I have never heard about it and think that it is fascinating to approach the issue with attributes that are not color.
								I did not realize the impact "focus states" and adding enough contrast can have on being more inclusive. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article are the visuals with the accessbility rating. The comparison of colors with those that are and are not
								color friendly are clear with the side by side images. It opened my eyes to the way that color is used and how we can use higher scored 
								colors in our digital products. </p>
