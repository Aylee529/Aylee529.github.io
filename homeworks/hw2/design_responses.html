						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that white space is welcomed in designing in online platforms and is 
								not always considered a bad thing. At my prior internship, the mindset of putting important
								elements above the fold was prioritized. This tainted my perception of web design, thinking
								that all of the most important aspects must be seen without scrolling. However, now I see that
								importance of white space outweighs the "above or below the fold" ascept and how users have 
								evolved to scrolling. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was the comparison of the Wayfar website with and without white
								space. It made the article more digestable and imaginable with the direct comparisons side by
								side.  I was able to identify how the navibility and accessibility was enhanced with the added
								white spaces. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Think you’re using too much white space? There’s a good chance you’re not. If anything, you’re 
								probably not using enough. When in doubt, add more white space…" </p>
						</li>
