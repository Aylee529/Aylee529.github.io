					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/Current wireframe.png"/>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/Redesigned wireframe.png"/>						
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of the website is to deliver access to music and podcasts to Spotify users. My deisgn accomplishes this by allowing for 
								flexibility with viewing their content and with a focus on playlists since that is a significant reason for spotify users. I also 
								tried to incorporate more white space to enhance navibility and user experience. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> I found the current wireframe to be too cluttered as it seemed like Spotify was trying to fit as many podcasts and playlists
								on one page and above the fold. My redesign solved this by limiting the amount of images of podcasts and playlists by allowing
								a "press for more" triangles of the playlist and podcase display </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
