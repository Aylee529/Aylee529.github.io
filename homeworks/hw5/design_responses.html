                            <p> I learned about how dynamics and interactive elements can be used to enhance the user experience.
                                By implementing action and intriguing visuals, the user is more inclined to scroll and stay longer on the
                            platform. Therefore, increasing the amount of time spent and the potential of user engagement.  </p>

                            <p> My favorite part was exploring the different interactions across the different types of websites.
                                Each interactive element was tailored towards each website's motivation and goals. I loved seeing the different 
                            possibilities and creavitity of the web developers. </p>

                            <p> My favorite inspiration was the "Selected Works Transitions Experiments by Zhenya Rynzhuk for Sochnik." 
                                The transition to the picture and the content was very creative and capitvating with the usage of the squares.
                                It introduced a modern feel to the experience, which elevated it to be sleek.  </p>
